# Unskinable

Summary - This application visualizes the passenger data of Titanic. It shows the age distribution of all passengers, their gender, and using the age & gender, the user can see seat class, their company and embarkment wise deaths and survival of titanic.

Design - First the application didn't have any interactivity. I had added the interactivity so that users can elpore on their own.


Feedback - Following are the feedback:
  User1: It looks great, but charts should be porperly labeled.
  User2: umm.... I think the filterable charts should show "hand cursor" also they should appear top of filtered charts.
  User3: I think it is a good visualization, but a light border around the the chart containers would look nicer also, the background can go a liiter lighter I think.
  
Resources - I used a combo of D3 & Dimple Js. Other than these, I've used Ajax & google fonts api.
